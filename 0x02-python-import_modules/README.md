# 0x02. Python - import & modules

## Introduction

In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` added. We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files.

## Import Statement

Python's `import` statement allows you to access code created in other Python files. You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file.

Here's a simple example:

```python
import math
print(math.pi)
```
In this example, math is a module and pi is a variable in the math module.
