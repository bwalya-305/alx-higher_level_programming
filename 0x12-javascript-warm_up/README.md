*0x12. JavaScript - Warm up*

avaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

-Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
-Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Disqus or Facebook.
-Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.
