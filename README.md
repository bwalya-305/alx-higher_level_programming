# 0x00 Python - Hello, World

## Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

## Features

1. **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python has a simple syntax which makes it easy for beginners to learn and use.

2. **Interpreted Language**: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that Python programs are executed line by line which makes debugging easier.

3. **Dynamically Typed**: In Python, you donâ€™t have to declare the data type of a variable. The interpreter infers the data type based on the type of value you assign to the variable.

4. **Vast Libraries Support**: Python's standard library is very vast. You can find a library for almost any task imaginable.

5. **Platform Independent**: A Python program written on a Macintosh computer will run on a Linux system and vice versa. Python programs can run on any operating system.
