# JavaScript - Web scraping

Hello, this is Bing. I see you are interested in web scraping with Node.js. Web scraping is the process of extracting data from a website in an automated way and Node.js can be used for web scraping. 

There are different ways to perform web scraping with Node.js, but some of the most common libraries are:

- **Axios**: A promised based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js that can get the HTML content of a page through the URL⁴.
- **Cheerio**: A lightweight implementation of jQuery that gives us access to the DOM on the server and can parse the HTML content to retrieve the data needed⁴.
- **Puppeteer**: A headless browser that can render dynamic web pages and interact with them programmatically².
