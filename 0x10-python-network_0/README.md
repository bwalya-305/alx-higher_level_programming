0x10. Python - Network #0

Python plays an essential role in network programming. The standard library of Python has full support for network protocols, encoding, and decoding of data and other networking concepts.

Python Network Services
There are two levels of network service access in Python. These are:

1. Low-Level Access
2. High-Level Access

In the first case, programmers can use and access the basic socket support for the operating system using Python's libraries, and programmers can implement both connection-less and connection-oriented protocols for programming.

Application-level network protocols can also be accessed using high-level access provided by Python libraries. These protocols are HTTP, FTP, etc.
